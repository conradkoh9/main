Added logging feature:

Sample code:

#include "Logger.h"
using namespace logging;

int main(){
    logfile << "this is a test log output";
}

Sample output:
[28/03/2015] [03:34AM]: this is a test log output

open the file debug.log in the folder [main\I_Schedule\I_ScheduleGUI] to outputs, and begin to use this feature
to score more marks in the grading! (:
